## Hi there 👋

I'm Eeshan. I lead a data science team at Starbucks focused on AI/ML, personalization, and experimentation, including recommendation models powering the Starbucks app for 40M+ users.

12+ years across engineering, marketing analytics, modeling, and team leadership. CS undergrad, MBA. Not ex-FAANG. Not Ivy League. Just someone who likes making things work, learning by doing, and working with smart people.

I build data science apps on the side using AI. Each one teaches me something—about systems, about design & architecture, about data, about what real users actually do. I have the classic "learning by doing" archetype that gives me the most joy while still putting in the work. By building and sharing, I'm hoping to learn as well as teach. If you're interested in geeking out with me, then shoot me a message on LinkedIn.

In my free time, I enjoy running, painting, reading, and basketball.

🔭 I’m currently working on building a [full-stack web app](https://eeshans.com/ab-simulator/) that shows A/B Testing in action by putting the user inside an experiment, displays live stats as more users join the experiment, and publishes a full statistical analysis to help make the final decision. 

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building data-science focused web apps on my (personal lab)[https://eeshans.com/]. Absolutely non-commercial and for learning only. Building & creating without limits.
