## Hi there 👋

I'm _Eeshan_. I lead a data science team at Starbucks focused on AI/ML, personalization, and experimentation, including recommendation models powering the Starbucks app for 40M+ users.

12+ years across engineering, marketing analytics, modeling, and team leadership. CS undergrad, MBA. Not ex-FAANG. Not Ivy League. Just someone who likes making things work, learning by doing, and working with smart people.

On the side, I build apps on AI, data science & privacy to understand what actually holds up beyond the demo. Each project goes end-to-end — design, engineering, analytics, real users, published analysis. Everything here is open source and non-commercial.

- 🔬 **Latest project**: Local LLM Bench — how accurate are local LLMs at structured extraction? Benchmarks across MLX and Ollama with F1 scoring and interactive reports.
- ✍️ **Writing**: [Asymptotic](https://theasymptotic.substack.com/) — pragmatic takes on AI, data science, and privacy. Past the hype cycles.
- 📫 **How to reach me**: [LinkedIn](https://eeshans.com/) | [Twitter / X](https://x.com/notesundrground)

In my free time, I enjoy kickboxing, running, painting, reading, and basketball.
