## Hi there 👋

I'm _Eeshan_. I lead a data science team at Starbucks focused on AI/ML, personalization, and experimentation, including recommendation models powering the Starbucks app for 40M+ users.

12+ years across engineering, marketing analytics, modeling, and team leadership. CS undergrad, MBA. Not ex-FAANG. Not Ivy League. Just someone who likes making things work, learning by doing, and working with smart people.

On the side, I build apps on AI, data science & privacy to see what will hold up beyond the hype cycles. Each project goes end-to-end — design, engineering, analytics, real users, published analysis. Everything here is open source and non-commercial.

🔬 **Latest projects**: 
- [A/B Testing Memory Game](https://eeshans.com/ab-simulator/) — a live experiment on difficulty and player behavior, with published statistical analysis. Play and contribute to the "power"!
- [Local LLM Bench](https://eeshansrivastava89.github.io/local-llm-bench/) — benchmarking local model accuracy on structured data extraction across MLX and Ollama
- [How I Prompt](https://howiprompt.eeshans.com/) — analyze your Claude conversation history and discover your prompting patterns

✍️ **Writing**: [Asymptotic](https://theasymptotic.substack.com/) — pragmatic takes on AI, data science, and privacy. Past the hype cycles.

In my free time, I enjoy kickboxing, running, painting, reading, and basketball.
